# 🏗️ Install

We recommend installing with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as a global CLI command:

## With uv (Recommended)

```sh
uv tool install clientele
```

## With pipx (Python)

```sh
pipx install clientele
```

## With Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```sh
brew install phalt/clientele/clientele
```

## With pip

```sh
pip install clientele
```

Once installed, you can run `clientele version` to make sure you have the latest version:

```sh
> clientele version
clientele 1.0.1
```
