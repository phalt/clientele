# 🏗️ Install

We recommend installing with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as a global CLI command:

## With pipx (Python)

```sh
pipx install clientele
```

## With uv (Python)

```sh
uv tool install clientele
```

Once installed, you can run `clientele version` to make sure you have the latest version:

```sh
> clientele version
clientele 1.0.0
```
